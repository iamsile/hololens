Abstract:
	The Home Decorum Augmented Reality project, currently unnamed, is a software application to be built for the
HoloLens platform, Microsoft's new wearable AR headset. The application primarily focuses on providing a 3D model
of specific floor fixtures and furniture available for purchase in a catalogue to allow the user to better visualize
any home improvement selections before making a purchase. The mission of the project is to provide users a more
immersive experience and relay as much information before making a purchase. The target user story involves the HoloLens
scanning a QR code placed beside a particular item in a catalogue. This QR code is mapped to a pre-generated 3D holographic 
model, which will be fetched and rendered in the field of view of the HoloLens. Then, using common, pre-defined gestures,
such as air-tapping, and pinching, the user will be able to interact with the model, by re-sizing, moving and pinning the
object hologram. Ultimately, the aim is to increase user adoption and educate users with the interface so they become
more comfortable with this new technology. As a result this same workflow, will also be applied to children's stories, 
where a QR code on the page can be scanned to display a 3D model of a character in the story (e.g. Winnie the Pooh).
We plan on working with RONA Inc. home improvement catalogues to select items for which 3D models will be available.
